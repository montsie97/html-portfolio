<h2>I aspire to become a Software Engineer.</h2> 
<h2>The following are my projects thus far:</h2>

<p>I am currently working through some projects I am crafting as I work along the Udemy: The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp course.</p>

<h3>This is my first project.</h3>
<p>I was tasked to list three films I liked. I chose Fall themed films and gave a brief description of what I love about each. I highly recommend you take some time to check them out.</p>

<h3>This is my second project.</h3>
<p>For this project we had to create a virtual birthday invitation. I was able to choose what the invite consisted of from the image to the Google Maps location for the event. By the way that is my real birth date!</p>
