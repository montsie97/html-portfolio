<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Montserrat Andrea Carracedo Olaechea (but you can call me Montsie) and I am from Per√∫ and I am first-generation American, having come to the U.S. when I was six years old. 
  Being Peruvian-American is the essence of who I am and becomming.

<p>I attended the Florida State University through a full ride scholarship program called the Center for Academic Retention and Enhancement (C.A.R.E),  a scholarship program 
  tailored to first-generation, minority, socio-economically disadvantaged students. At FSU I learned the value of resiliency and community through parttaking in various 
  leadership programs, such as LeaderShape 2018 and PeaceJam Southeast. The coursework at FSU is nothing short of rigorous and thrilling. I genuinely love to learn and found 
  the university I attended to be everything I needed to grow and develop into the person I am today. I graduated in 2021 with a double major Bachelor's of Science in 
  Political Science & Literature.

<p>Some interesting aspects of myself are that I love to crochet all sorts of projects, from quirky hats to aesthetic bags and clothing. I also enjoy the best of both worlds; 
  cozy video games and reading. I enjoy runs in the brisk morning, as well as home workouts.
